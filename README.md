How do I approach designing software?

I start off by carefully reading the design documents to see what I need to incorporate then I write skeleton funtions and update the header files.
I do it this way for orginizational reasons, I learned this very well in this class due to other wise having ginormous functions.The outlining with
The functions just helps me design from the beginning so I have an on how to approach the who project. This will be super helpful for me on future
projects because being able to design and build a skeleton really made my workflow so much faster. 

How do I approach developing programs?

My first attempt when I am developing a solution if I don't already have one is to use a previous solution for a similar problem and edit it. This
was incredibly useful through out this program due to the repition of lines needed for each 3D object designed. An example of this is that the program 
has in quadrant II 16 individual bushes all with individual defined locations and roots where each root is two cones with defined locations. A solution
I found was that I could build a root knowing the center of every bush and developed a root placements method.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

I personally do not have any inclination to go into computational graphics and visualizations, this class has more so helped me build my development style.
I also learned that I could probably use this as a way to show someone a design more easily than I could do it in paint.
